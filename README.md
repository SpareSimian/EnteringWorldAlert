# EnteringWorldAlert
Play an alert sound when entering the world

When one uses lots of addons, entering the world or zoning (hearthing
and taking portals) can take quite a long time. This addon plays a
sound to alert the player when zoning is complete. This lets you
alt-tab out to do tasks outside the game while you wait.
